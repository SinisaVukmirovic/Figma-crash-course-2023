#### Moving around - hold down space key and left mouse to drag around

#### Zoom - Hold CTRL and scroll mouse scroll to zoom in and out

#### Setting up grid - click + next to the Layout Grid button on the right panel => click on the grid symbol to the left on the button, choose Collumns, 12 and a margin (140px in this case)

#### To see the exact values of elements position, select element, hold ALT and hover mouse cursor somewhere around the middle of the X or Y axis to see the number values and red lines

#### To type in some text => Text T tool on the tool bar, click where you want it, type in the desired text. After that we get options on the right, like, font family, type, font size, and with click on 3 dots we get more options like "all uppercase"... (dash - to turn it off)

### Bounding boxes of 2 elements shouldn't be overlapping eachother. That way we can, easily, select both by clicking and holding shift key and create an Auto Layout from those 2 elements, by clicking Auto Layout in the options on the right, after which we get auto layout options.

### To create a Component we select and element(s) and click on Create component button on the top of the screen window. Now if we duplica that element, any change applied to the master/initial component's element will transfer onto the duplicates of that component element

### Component Variants - we can create a separate page for variants or a separe frame, and create component variants by clicking Create Variant inthe same top button whenre create compoents was before. We can create multiple variants of our component for, for example, active, default and hover state of out navbar link.
#### In component variants, under text type options on the right, we should change Fixed Width to Auto Width, so that any future change of text lenght will not cause a break of text.
### To get the new created component variant into our design, we go to Assets on the panel on the left => component variants, click and drag our component variant onto our design frame.

#### Rullers and guidelines - Shift + R to get the rullers on top and left of the desing frame, click and drag to place a guide line.

#### Holding Alt key when resising element makes the element resise, both, on left are right side
